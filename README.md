This is a Flask-based web application that uses a FastAI deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, or Normal. The app predicts the condition and provides detailed information about the disease and its risk factors, making it useful for early screening and educational purposes.
